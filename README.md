# ppg

This repo houses the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG) taxonomic database for ferns and lycophytes.

[Issues](https://github.com/pteridogroup/ppg/issues) are used to discuss taxonomic proposals by the PPG community, which are voted on monthly. All proposals are relative to [PPG I (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12229). To propose a taxonomic change, use the [taxonomic proposal template](https://github.com/pteridogroup/ppg/issues/new?assignees=&labels=taxonomic+proposal&template=taxonomic-proposal.yml). Proposals that pass by a 2/3 majority will be implemented in the taxonomic database. 

For more information about PPG, see the [PPG webpage](https://pteridogroup.github.io/).

**IMPORTANT**: if you want to [participate](#contributing), please read the [Project Guidelines](https://pteridogroup.github.io/guidelines.html) first.

## Format

The database is provided as [a CSV file](data/ppg.csv) in the [Darwin Core (DwC) format](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#taxon) for taxonomic data.

A human readable summary of the same data is available as [a plain text file](data/ppg.md) in Markdown format.

Currently, the database includes only names at the genus level and higher, but we intend to include species and infraspecific taxa in the future.

## Versioning

The data are currently being updated to reflect changes that have taken place since [PPG I (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12229). Once this is done, a version number will be assigned. Therefore, **these data should not be taken as the official PPG system until a version number is assigned**.

## Contributing

All taxonomic decisions are made by the PPG community.

Taxonomic proposals should be submitted as [issues](https://github.com/pteridogroup/ppg/issues/new?assignees=&labels=taxonomic+proposal&template=taxonomic-proposal.yml), which will be voted on monthly. Proposals may be commented upon in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pteridogroup/ppg/issues). Voting is carried out separately via a Google Form survey circulated on the PPG mailing list. Any proposal receiving >2/3 support will be approved and implemented in the data.

Anybody is welcome to contribute. All participants must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://pteridogroup.github.io/coc.html). Please read the [Project Guidelines](https://pteridogroup.github.io/guidelines.html) before contributing.

## Running with Docker

### Basic usage

Launch a container in the background:

```
docker run \
  --rm \
  -dt \
  -v ${PWD}:/wd \
  -w /wd \
  --user root \
  joelnitta/ppg:latest bash
```

### Development

Specify user and git files


```
docker run --rm -dt \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v ${PWD}:/wd \
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/home/user/.gitconfig:ro \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/home/user/.ssh:ro \
  -w /wd \
  joelnitta/ppg:latest bash
```

### Cron job

Run as root to enable the cron job, which will run the `targets` workflow once per day.

Gitconfig and ssh are needed to commit and push data files to GitHub.

```
docker run --rm -dt \
  -w /wd \
  --name ppg_make \
  --user root \
  -v ${PWD}:/wd \
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro \
  joelnitta/ppg:latest cron -f
```
